# Linear-programming-solver
This project is a webapp made to solve linear programming problem using the simplex method, the backend is made in python using Flask, and the frontend is made using HTML/CSS and Javascript.


## Running the project

To run the project you need to have python installed in your machine, then you can run the following commands:

```bash
